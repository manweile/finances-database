# Personal Finance Database and Dashboard
In this project, I developed a MySQL database tracking all of my financial transactions. This includes purchases, deposits, withdraws, credit card payments, and more. Any transaction that results in a change in a bank account or credit card balance is tracked in this database. These transactions are extracted from my banking website in the form of csv files, transformed using customized Python scripts, and loaded into the database via the sqlalchemy Python libray. I then created SQL views to understand my spending habits and developed a Power BI dashboard linked to the MySQL database to view these habits visually.

## Inspiration
My inspiration for developing a financial database and dashboard stemmed from a desire to gain a deeper understanding of my spending habits. I was motivated by the idea of having a comprehensive tool that would allow me to track and analyze my expenses, giving me valuable insights into my financial patterns. I wanted to effortlessly visualize which categories I spent the most on and observe how my spending habits evolved over time. By creating this database and dashboard, I aimed to empower myself with knowledge and make informed decisions about my finances, ultimately working towards improving my financial well-being.
